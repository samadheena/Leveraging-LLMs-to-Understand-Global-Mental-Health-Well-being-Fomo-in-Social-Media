So I thought that since other children always preferred to insult and exclude me and never showed interest in treating me in a positive way, friendships as seen in books and television must√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been made up like magic and superpowers. My parents encouraged this idea and told me I expected too much from other children and that if nobody wanted to be nice to me, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s because something is wrong with me and I must be a bad person.

"Ever since I was 15, I have been social isolated with zero friends and have been completely withdrawn from any type of socialization except around my two parents, both of which are toxic people. I was diagnosed with clinical depression then but didn't get any help as I didn't have a support network and wasn't motivated enough to seek help.

One of the worst things about growing up with my particular brand of nmom is that I‚Äôve been gaslighted so much that I no longer think anything I would contribute to a conversation is worth the effort.

Even in this sub I‚Äôve tried to engage with other people who have similar experiences and I end up erasing my comments. I gaslight myself now that my experiences are invalid and I‚Äôm being too sensitive. I tell myself that she wasn‚Äôt as bad as other nparents so no one cares about my experiences. I‚Äôm an adult now (36f) and I feel so isolated and unable to maintain relationships. Why would I reach out to old friends when I‚Äôd have nothing of interest to contribute to a conversation?

"Ive been pretty socially isolated for about 6 years now. I live alone. I have a really high paying job. My co workers view me as very normal and have no idea what I used to be like (from a depression and anxiety standpoint). People think I have a normal social life and friends. I do not. I sit in my apartment alone most weekends and hate it. I have a fair amount of acquaintances, but almost no legitimate friends.

"Has anybody else had no genuine friendships as a child? Will the feeling ever go away? I was bullied since I was 3. When I was 4, a girl I tried to be friends with told me she hated me.

So I thought that since other children always preferred to insult and exclude me and never showed interest in treating me in a positive way, friendships as seen in books and television mustâ€™ve been made up like magic and superpowers.

"Ever since I was 15, I have been social isolated with zero friends and have been completely withdrawn from any type of socialization except around my two parents, both of which are toxic people. I was diagnosed with clinical depression then but didn't get any help as I didn't have a support network and wasn't motivated enough to seek help.

One of the worst things about growing up with my particular brand of nmom is that I’ve been gaslighted so much that I no longer think anything I would contribute to a conversation is worth the effort. I have almost zero social media presence because I honestly don’t believe anyone cares what I have to say/what’s going on in my life. Even in this sub I’ve tried to engage with other people who have similar experiences and I end up erasing my comments. I gaslight myself now that my experiences are invalid and I’m being too sensitive. I tell myself that she wasn’t as bad as other nparents so no one cares about my experiences. I’m an adult now (36f) and I feel so isolated and unable to maintain relationships. Why would I reach out to old friends when I’d have nothing of interest to contribute to a conversation? Why would I call my family when i have nothing to say? If it wasn’t for my partner I wouldn’t interact with anyone outside of work.,"I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and hopeless.

"Ive been pretty socially isolated for about 6 years now. I live alone. I have a really high paying job. My co workers view me as very normal and have no idea what I used to be like (from a depression and anxiety standpoint). People think I have a normal social life and friends. I do not. I sit in my apartment alone most weekends and hate it. I have a fair amount of acquaintances, but almost no legitimate friends. Its actually easier for me to date at this point than find a few legitimate guy friends that I can hang out with regularly. All I want out of life right now is a great group of guy friends. Have I missed the boat? Is it even possible to get an awesome group of guy friends in your late 20s? Basically everyone I run into hangs out with their college buddies. I dont have any. And its really hard to relate to people because I didnt do anything normal/social for about 5 years in my life. Im way behind on the boat. I cant relate to any drinking activities because I never did any of that. No concerts. No college friends I can talk about. Im basically a loner. How do I change this?
